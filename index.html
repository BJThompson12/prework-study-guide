        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users. This includes the colors, aesthetucs, visual layout, and organization.CSS is used to define style rules for specific elements of an HTML page and format them using a wide range of style options.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS: Used to style an element directly in the HTML file. Applies to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only. Quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets, because each inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change.</li>
          <li>Internal CSS style sheet: Embed an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML by using style element in the head element. Rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code.</li>
          <li>External CSS style sheet: Allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
          <li>Selector: define the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations will apply</li>
          <li>Declarations contain: CSS property you want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
          <li>Margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element. The margin is not visible on the page</li>
          <li>Padding property adds space around the content inside an element. When you increase padding, you are actually making the entire element bigger.</li>
          <li>Wild card selector allows you to apply the rule to all the elements visible on the page</li>
          <li>You can combine 2 or more selectors with a comma</li>
          <li>Block value assigns to start on a new line</li>
          <li>Link element creates a connetion to an external file</li>
          <li>Rel attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource</li>
          <li>href uses the relative path </li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector. Then the class attribute can be assigned to the element in the HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule.</li>
          <li>Box Shadow CSS property adds shadow effects around an element's frame. You can set multiple effects separated by commas. A box shadow is described by X and Y offsets relative to the element, blur and spread radius, and color. The X offset defines the width or extent of the shadow on the X axis (or to the right of the box); the Y offset defines the extent on the Y axis (or just below the box)</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website</li>
          <li>If the JavaScript loads first and it is supposed to affect the HTML that hasn't loaded yet, there could be problems. Placing JavaScript near the bottom of an HTML page is one way to accommodate this dependency.</li>
          <li>JavaScript is case sensitive</li>
          <li>If you see something which looks like a variable name, but it's followed by parentheses‚Äî () ‚Äîit is likely a function.</li>
          <li>The Null type is inhabited by exactly one value: null</li>
          <li>Undefined indicates the absence of a value, while null indicates the absence of an object</li>
          <li>The Boolean type represents a logical entity and is inhabited by two values: true and false</li>
          <li>In JavaScript, objects are the only mutable values. Functions are, in fact, also objects with the additional capability of being callable.</li>
          <li>When representing dates, the best choice is to use the built-in Date utility in JavaScript</li>
          <li>A variable is simply a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>var is used to declare a variable. After declared it must be given a unique name ot be referenced in the code later on.</li>
          <li>Each line of JavaScript code ends with a semicolon.</li>
          <li>Logging objects: use console.log(JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj)))</li>
          <li>In JavaScript, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the page</li>
          <li>An if statement is a way of introducing decision-making into our code.</li>
          <li>A value is considered falsy if it is one of the following values: 0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN, or a Boolean data type with the value of false. All other values, including a Boolean with the value of true, are considered truthy. </li>
          <li>The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a Boolean result true if the values are equal and false if the values are not equal.</li>
          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over. </li>
          <li>The code x++ is a shortcut way of writing x+1</li>
          <li>The LENGTH( ) function counts the number of characters in string, including any spaces, and returns the number.</li>

          <li>git: Software on computer that tracks changes you make to your code</li>
          <li>Separation of concerns: separating code into different files based on use</li>
          <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) Code: encourages devs to reuse or share pieces fo code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained</li>
          <li>PX: Pixels</li>

          <li>Operator is a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values (or variables).</li>
          <li>Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not</li>
          <li>Functions are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse. It's possible to define a body of code as a function that executes when you call the function name in your code.</li>
          <li>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format, derived from JavaScript, but used by many programming languages. JSON builds universal data structures that can be transferred between different environments and even across languages.</li>
