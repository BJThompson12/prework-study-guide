        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users. This includes the colors, aesthetucs, visual layout, and organization.CSS is used to define style rules for specific elements of an HTML page and format them using a wide range of style options.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS: Used to style an element directly in the HTML file. Applies to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only. Quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets, because each inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change.</li>
          <li>Internal CSS style sheet: Embed an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML by using style element in the head element. Rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code.</li>
          <li>External CSS style sheet: Allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
          <li>Selector: define the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations will apply</li>
          <li>Declarations contain: CSS property you want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
          <li>Margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element. The margin is not visible on the page</li>
          <li>Padding property adds space around the content inside an element. When you increase padding, you are actually making the entire element bigger.</li>
          <li>Wild card selector allows you to apply the rule to all the elements visible on the page</li>
          <li>You can combine 2 or more selectors with a comma</li>
          <li>Block value assigns to start on a new line</li>
          <li>Link element creates a connetion to an external file</li>
          <li>Rel attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource</li>
          <li>href uses the relative path </li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector. Then the class attribute can be assigned to the element in the HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule.</li>
          <li>Box Shadow CSS property adds shadow effects around an element's frame. You can set multiple effects separated by commas. A box shadow is described by X and Y offsets relative to the element, blur and spread radius, and color. The X offset defines the width or extent of the shadow on the X axis (or to the right of the box); the Y offset defines the extent on the Y axis (or just below the box)</li>
